# Convert Decimal Mantissa to Arbitrary Mantissa
CS 417: Machine Assignment 2

Program takes in command-line arguments and converts them from base ten to base two.

## To run this program 
1)  Compile the files using "javac ConvertDecimalMantissa.java"
2) Then run "java ConvertDecimalMantissa **_base_ _value_ _value_**...."


## Goal for Assignment:
Write a program that receives a real number in decimal (base 10) and converts it into any base (e.g., 2, 8, 16, 60). This
base must be accepted as the first command line argument.

* You must implement the algorithm discussed in Chapter 1.
* You may not use libraries or built-in functions (e.g., Double.toHexString(. . . ) in Java or
”{0:b}”.format(. . . ) in Python)

You may assume that all input is well-formed (i.e., all inputs are valid real numbers). You need not (and should not)
expect illegal inputs (e.g., ”0.1LOL”).
